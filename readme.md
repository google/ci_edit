# What is ci_edit

ci_edit is a text editor. It can help you view or edit text files.

ci_edit runs in the command line (also called the terminal). To start using
ci_edit, download ci_edit and open (execute) `ci.py`.


## What ci_edit can do for you

Many other command line text editors require learning a different set of mouse
and keyboard commands. Many of us use a graphical editor (GUI) that supports
a common set of commands like `ctrl+q` to quit (that is, hold the control key and
press Q). Here are a few common commands:

  - ctrl+q    to quit the program
  - ctrl+s    to save the file
  - ctrl+z    undo
  - ctrl+x    cut
  - ctrl+c    copy
  - ctrl+v    paste

There are more, but you probably get the idea. These common controls are not
common in command line editors.

So, what if you'd like to edit a file in the terminal window but don't want to
recall how to save or quit in an unfamiliar editor? This is where ci_edit
shines, because ci_edit does support those familiar key sequences. You already
know how to save in ci_edit, it's `ctrl+s`. Simple.

This version of ci_edit still doesn't have all the intended features, but it's
a start. It's has the necessary features of a basic text editor and a few fancy
extras. Those fancy extras stay out of your way until you want them.

### Installation (Linux / Mac OS)

* Execute the install script with root privileges.  Either change directory
  `cd` to the downloaded directory (or local repository): `ci_edit`, or use
  the path to the installation file (i.e. `./[PATH_TO_FILE]/install.sh`).

```
$ sudo ./install.sh
```

* **Note:** This script creates a copy of the repository in the directory
  `/opt/ci_edit/`; the **update**, overwrites that copy.  Then a symbolic
  link is created in the directory `/usr/local/bin/`, which is generally
  designated for user programs not managed by the distribution package manager

### Usage

* This command opens the text editor from any directory.  The execution command
  for the editor can be specified by user choice during installation or
  manually.

```
$ we
```

* To edit a file (such as `README.md`) by name:

```
$ we README.md
```

## What you can do for ci_edit


The help we now need is finding out what puts users off; what causes someone who
tries the editor to stop using it. We intend to address those issues so that
more users are happy users for a longer time.

# Obligatory


## Origins

The world does need another text editor. (Or at least I think so).

There are other fine curses based editors. I found that I was often trying to
tweak them to get just what I wanted. Almost as often, some aspect of those
editors prevented that last little bit of customization. So writing a text
editor should allow all the customization I like, right?

Writing a text editor is an interesting project. Give it a try sometime.
