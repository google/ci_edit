# Find UI

## What features should a find / replace tool have

find (xor i.e. a radio button or dropdown selection)
- all
- next
- prior

replace (xor)
-  all
-  current
-  next
-  prior

regex (boolean)
match case (exact)
smart cap replacement (boolean, smart means that lower case says lower case; upper case stays upper case)
span lines (boolean. aka wrap)
whole words (boolean, aka by word)
within (as in, find within this context)
-  anything (same as selecting all options?)
-  comments (a grammar?)
-  code (a grammar?)
-  licenses (a grammar?)
-  selection
-  quoted (strings) though maybe this is a grammar
-  a particular grammar (like py, js, cpp)

files
-  recursive (boolean)
-  where (multi-selection i.e. checkboxes)
    - current file
    - open files
    - current directory (or include '.')
    - path
        - include (list of strings)
        - exclude (list of strings)

Maybe (not sure on these)
-  mark lines with matches (boolean)
-  querySelect style
-  find misspelled word
-  error (i.e. go to the next compile error or similar)
-  external call/script
-  highlight all matches (boolean)

## Might be a silly idea, but what about a set notation so say where and how to search

Something that would describe what to search (e.g. search in comments or don't search in comments).

 within: code || comments || content || markup || quoted /* && marked && selection */
 within: -code +comments -content &marked +markup &quoted =selection


## Here is a draft of a multi-line find UI

```
   find: dog
replace: cat
options: -exact +highlight +regex +smart -words +wrap
 within: +code +comments +content +markup +quotes
that is: -marked -selected -changed
  paths: +example.txt
exit^w  forward^f  reverse^r  replace^s  all^e  mark^m
```


or



```
   find: dog
         +regex -words -matchCase +multiLine #  +marked
replace: cat
         case(simple smart upper +lower) # +mark
 within: +code +comments +content +markup +quotes +license
         ~selected +changed #  !marked
  paths: +example.txt
<exit>  <reverse>  <forward>  <replace>  <all>  #  mark^m
```





```
   find: dog
replace: cat
         [*]regex, [ ]words, [ ]matchCase, [ ]multiLine
         within: ( )code, ( )comments, ( )markup, ( )quotes, ( )license, ( )any;
         selected: ( )yes, ( )no, (*)any;
         changed: ( )yes, ( )no, (*)any;
         paths: +example.txt
         changeCase: (*)none, ( )smart, ( )upper, ( )lower;
<exit>  <reverse>  <forward>  <replace>  <all>  #  mark^m
```






```
   find: dog
replace: cat
         [*]regex [ ]words [ ]matchCase [ ]multiLine
         within: ( )code ( )comments ( )markup ( )quotes ( )license (*)any
         selected: ( )yes ( )no (*)any
         changed: ( )yes ( )no (*)any
         paths: +example.txt
         changeCase: (*)none ( )smart ( )upper ( )lower
<exit>  <reverse>  <forward>  <replace>  <all>  #  mark^m
```







```
   find: dog
replace: cat
         [*]regex [ ]words [ ]matchCase [ ]multiLine
         changeCase: {none}
         within: {any}
         selected: {any}
         changed: {any}
  paths: +example.txt
<exit>  <reverse>  <forward>  <replace>  <all>  #  mark^m
```



## There are some options that I'd like to operate on the main document
undo/redo/save/quit if these actions are done in the find UI, they should affect the current file.
